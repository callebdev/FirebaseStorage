# FirebaseStorage
This repository contains an Android app written in Kotlin that uploads files (documents (pdf, docx), images, audios and videos) to Firebase Storage.

## How does the app work?
The app has five buttons that allow you to choose the file type you want to upload.
When you click on a button, through a ACTION_GET_CONTENT intent it allows you to choose a file to upload.
Then it shows the file URI while uploading the image, after uploading it shows you the URL too.

## Prerequisites

* ``Android Studio 3.5``

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) - Programming language used to create app
